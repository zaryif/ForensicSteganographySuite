# Project Explanation & Theory

**Subject:** Radiohead Vault Anti-Forensics

## 1. The Core Problem

Standard steganography tools (like OpenStego or Steghide default settings) leave a "statistical signature."

**The Cliff:** If you hide 5MB of data in a 20MB image, the first 5MB of pixels look random (high entropy), and the remaining 15MB look natural (low entropy).

**The Detection:** Forensic tools detect this transition "cliff" to prove data is hidden.

## 2. The Solution: CSPRNG Noise Floor

Radiohead Vault v5.0 implements a "Full Surface Noise Injection."
After writing the encrypted data, the algorithm continues to the end of the file, filling every remaining pixel with data generated by a Cryptographically Secure Pseudo-Random Number Generator (CSPRNG).

**Result:** The entire file appears to have uniform high entropy. It is mathematically indistinguishable from a high-ISO photograph or a noisy audio recording.

## 3. Format Selection

We strictly use Lossless formats:

*   **PNG:** For images.
*   **WAV:** For audio.

We **REJECT** JPG and MP4 because they use "Lossy" compression (DCT/Quantization), which destroys the bit-level modifications required for this technique.

## 4. Operational Security

For maximum security, this tool is designed to be run in a RAM-only environment (e.g., Tails OS). This prevents the Operating System from creating "Swap Files" or "Thumbnail Caches" that could leak the existence of the hidden data to a forensic investigator.
